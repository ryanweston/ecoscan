# EcoScan application

Repository for the mobile application, EcoScan. 

Currently only built for iOS using React Native. 

# Installation & setup

## Prerequisites:
 - [XCode v12+](https://developer.apple.com/download/release/) You may need to ensure your apple ID is a developer account for this)
 - [Command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/release/) In XCode go to preferences > locations in Xcode and select the latest command line version.
 - [Node v16.X.X](https://nodejs.org/en/) Node 17 is known to produce errors with running Metro & React Native. We recommend using n to help manage n versions if necessary.

## Development Environment

Open your terminal application.

Install Homebrew:

``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

If you don’t already have Node installed, React Native docs recommends installing Node through homebrew.
Disclaimer: This has yet to be tested with a Homebrew Node installation

```bash 
brew install node
```

Install watchman in a new terminal:

```bash
brew install watchman
```

Install cocoapods in another new terminal: 

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

If this doesn't run, cleanup your homebrew: 

```bash
brew cleanup -d -v
```

If again, it doesn't work, ensure your paths are exported correctly.

Ensure yarn is installed globally.
```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

## Installation

At the top level, install packages with yarn.
```bash 
yarn
```

Open XCode and change the build schema to debug 

``` Scroll to 'How to deploy' for an example on how to do this.```


Install pods in the ios folder.
```bash 
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Create a .env file at root level and replace with your information: 

```bash 
API_URL=‘EXAMPLE URL’
GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT=‘EXAMPLE WEB CLIENT ID’
GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT=‘EX’AMPLE IOS CLIENT ID’
```

# Running the simulator

I've primarly used XCode in my development flow over the command line.

To run this way, select a simulator device form the top middle toolbar.

Click the build button (play icon) to the left of the toolbar.

Once built, you can refresh the simulator by pressing the 'R' key inside the opened Metro terminal.

# Run simulator on M1

XCode has a few issues with running simulators on ARM64 architectures. You can resolve this in XCode build settings:

`EcoScan project folder > Build Settings > Excluded Architecture > Set both emulator values to ARM64`

`EcoScan pod folder > Build Settings > Excluded Architecture > Set both emulator values to ARM64`

# Run simulator on external device

## Add your developer account & certificates

Add your developer account to XCode if you haven't already:

`XCode > Preferences > Accounts > Add account (Plus icon) > Apple ID`

Select 'Manage certicates' and add a new Apple development certificate.

Close and click download manual profiles.

Change the bundle identifier to an ID of your choice.

Add your certificates to your external iPhone:

`Settings -> General -> Device Management and "trust" yourself as developer.`

## Apply your account

Ensure your personal developer account is selected as the team here:

`EcoScan project folder > General`

Also that your bundle identifier is set to your new one:

`EcoScan project folder > Signing and capabilities`

## Select & build

Select your connected iPhone from the top middle toolbar.

Click the build button (play icon) to the left of the toolbar.

# Commit style
Commit messages must conform to the to the [conventional commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

```bash

```

Message types:

- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

# How to deploy

We're currently running on TestFlight. 

Ensure your apple developer account is linked to the app's development team.

## Set schema to release

Select project in the toolbar, select edit schemas, as shown:

![Schema open menu](https://i.ibb.co/xfYF6Mj/Screenshot-2022-01-09-at-18-39-06.png)

Set build configuration in the popup to release, as shown:

![Schema set](https://i.ibb.co/NYKkN9h/Screenshot-2022-01-09-at-18-39-23.png)

## Archive and release

Go to product menu and select archive: Product > Archive

After the archive has finished, a screen will popup showing all your previous builds:

![Schema set](https://i.ibb.co/zN2vYNL/Screenshot-2022-01-09-at-18-48-43.png)

Here you want to select 'distribute app' and click through with all the default options.

# Common errors

If your metro fails from closing incorrectly with a cache error.
This process should also be your first call with most errors.

Delete node modules then run the following commands:

```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
cd .. 
yarn
cd ios
pod install
```
